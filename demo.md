## Why does this tutorial level matter?
One of the academic goals of this course is learning about new frameworks to study the history of the internet. The frameworks could be a little intimading and diffilcult to get understand for first time users, soa tutorial such as the one we are completing is important for making all the student in the class feel comfotrable with these tools and create a foundation for future work.
